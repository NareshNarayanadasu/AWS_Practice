# IBM Cloud Migration Requirements

## Overview
IBM is transitioning their application infrastructure from a local environment to the cloud. They require a robust and scalable solution that includes a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with specific networking, routing, and monitoring capabilities.

## 1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Setup
- **VPC Creation**
  - Create a VPC with a CIDR block that accommodates 8,192 IPs (e.g., `10.0.0.0/19`).
  
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)**
  - Attach an Internet Gateway (IGW) to the VPC for internet access.

## 2. Subnet Configuration
### App Subnet
- **CIDR Block:** `10.0.0.0/20` (provides up to 4,096 IPs).
- **Public Access:** Associate the App Subnet with the IGW.
- **Route Table:** Create a route table for the App Subnet with routes directing traffic to the IGW.

### Database Subnet
- **CIDR Block:** `10.0.16.0/20` (provides up to 4,096 IPs).
- **Private Access:** Ensure the DB Subnet does not route through the IGW.
- **Route Table:** Create a separate route table for the DB Subnet with no IGW connection.

## 3. Routing Configuration
### Route Tables
- **App Route Table**
  - Routes:
    - `0.0.0.0/0` → IGW (for internet access)
  
- **DB Route Table**
  - No routes to IGW (ensuring it's strictly private).

## 4. Load Balancer Setup
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**
  - Deploy an ELB to distribute incoming traffic across application servers in the App Subnet.

## 5. Monitoring and Notification
- **Amazon CloudWatch**
  - Create a CloudWatch Dashboard to monitor application server metrics (CPU, memory, etc.).
  - Set up CloudWatch Alarms to trigger on server crashes.

- **Simple Notification Service (SNS)**
  - Create an SNS topic to send notifications to admins when an alarm is triggered.

## 6. Fault Tolerance
- **Auto Scaling**
  - Configure Auto Scaling groups for the App Subnet to automatically replace unhealthy instances.
  - Set policies for scaling in and out to maintain performance and availability.

## 7. Zero Downtime Deployment
- **Deployment Strategies**
  - Utilize rolling updates or blue/green deployments to ensure zero downtime during updates.

## 8. Custom Domain Setup
- **Route 53**
  - Create a custom domain in Route 53 and set up DNS records to point to the ELB.

## Summary of Components
- **VPC:** `10.0.0.0/19` with IGW
- **App Subnet:** `10.0.0.0/20` (public access)
- **DB Subnet:** `10.0.16.0/20` (private access)
- **Load Balancer:** To distribute traffic
- **CloudWatch & SNS:** For monitoring and alerts
- **Auto Scaling:** For fault tolerance
- **Route 53:** For custom domain management

## Additional Considerations
- **Security Groups and NACLs:** Configure security groups to control access to application and database servers.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Implement regular backups for databases to ensure data integrity and quick recovery.
Certainly! Here's a structured outline to meet IBM's requirements for migrating their application infrastructure to the cloud. This includes setting up a VPC, subnets, routing, load balancing, monitoring, and fault tolerance.
