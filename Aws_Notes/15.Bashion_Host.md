### Setting Up EC2 Instances in Private Subnets and Configuring Bastion Hosts with VPC Peering

This setup involves launching private EC2 instances in different subnets, deploying public EC2 instances as bastion hosts, and establishing VPC peering for cross-VPC communication.

#### **Step 1: Launching EC2 Instances in Private Subnets**

1. **Launch Dell Pvt EC2 Instance**:
   - Subnet: `DellPvtSubnet` (CIDR: 192.168.1.0/24)
   - Security Group: Allow only internal communication (no internet access).
   - No public IP assigned.

2. **Launch Aja Pvt EC2 Instance**:
   - Subnet: `AjaPvtSubnet` (CIDR: defined in Aja VPC).
   - Security Group: Allow only internal communication (no internet access).
   - No public IP assigned.

#### **Step 2: Launching Bastion Hosts**

1. **Launch Public EC2 in Dell Pub**:
   - Subnet: `DellPubSubnet` (CIDR: 192.168.0.0/24).
   - Assign a public IP address.
   - Security Group: Allow SSH (port 22) access from your IP.

2. **Launch Public EC2 in Aja Pub**:
   - Subnet: `AjaPubSubnet` (CIDR: defined in Aja VPC).
   - Assign a public IP address.
   - Security Group: Allow SSH (port 22) access from your IP.

#### **Step 3: Configure Bastion Host Access**

1. **Connect to the Aja Pub Bastion Host**:
   - SSH into the instance:
     ```bash
     ssh -i demo.pem ec2-user@<Aja-Pub-Instance-Public-IP>
     ```
   - Copy the private key file (`.pem`) to the bastion host:
     ```bash
     scp -i demo.pem demo.pem ec2-user@<Aja-Pub-Instance-Public-IP>:~
     ```
   - Modify the permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod 400 demo.pem
     ```

2. **Connect to the Aja Pvt EC2**:
   - Use the bastion host to SSH into the private EC2 instance:
     ```bash
     ssh -i demo.pem ec2-user@<Aja-Pvt-Instance-Private-IP>
     ```

3. **Repeat for Dell Instances**:
   - SSH into the Dell Pub bastion host.
   - Copy the private key file (`.pem`) to the bastion host.
   - Modify the permissions.
   - SSH into the Dell Pvt EC2 instance via the Dell Pub bastion host.

#### **Step 4: VPC Peering Configuration**

1. **Initiate Peering Connection**:
   - Go to the VPC Console.
   - Under **Peering Connections**, click **Create Peering Connection**.
   - Configure the connection:
     - **Requester VPC**: Dell VPC.
     - **Accepter VPC**: Aja VPC.

2. **Accept the Peering Connection**:
   - In the Accepter VPC account, go to **Peering Connections** and accept the request.

3. **Update Route Tables**:
   - In Dell VPC:
     - Add a route to the Aja VPC CIDR block via the peering connection.
   - In Aja VPC:
     - Add a route to the Dell VPC CIDR block via the peering connection.

4. **Modify Security Groups**:
   - Update security groups in both VPCs to allow traffic between the Dell and Aja VPC CIDR blocks.

5. **Test Connectivity**:
   - From Dell Pvt EC2, ping or SSH to Aja Pvt EC2 (and vice versa) to verify connectivity.

This setup ensures secure access to private EC2 instances via bastion hosts and enables cross-VPC communication using VPC peering.
