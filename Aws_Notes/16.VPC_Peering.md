### What is VPC Peering?

**VPC Peering** is a private networking connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that allows instances in these VPCs to communicate with each other using private IP addresses. It acts as a secure and seamless link between VPCs, enabling efficient sharing of resources.

#### **Key Features of VPC Peering**
1. **Private Communication**: Traffic remains within the AWS network, ensuring security.
2. **Two-Way Communication**: Both VPCs can send and receive traffic.
3. **No Overlapping CIDR Blocks**: Peering is possible only when the CIDR ranges of the VPCs do not overlap.
4. **Regional or Inter-Regional**: Can be within the same region or across AWS regions.

### **Steps to Create a VPC Peering Connection**

1. **Initiate a Peering Request**
   - Go to the **VPC Console**.
   - Navigate to **Peering Connections** and click **Create Peering Connection**.
   - Provide a **Name Tag** (e.g., `Aja-Dell-Peering`).
   - Select:
     - **Local VPC**: Choose the requester VPC (e.g., `Aja VPC`).
     - **Accepter VPC**: Choose the accepter VPC (e.g., `Dell VPC`).
   - Click **Create Peering Connection**.

2. **Accept the Peering Request**
   - In the accepter VPCâ€™s account, navigate to **Peering Connections**.
   - Select the pending request.
   - From the **Actions** menu, choose **Accept Request**.
   - The peering connection becomes active.

### **Update Route Tables for Communication**

After activating the peering connection, you need to update route tables in both VPCs to enable traffic routing.

1. **Modify Aja VPC's Route Table**:
   - Navigate to the **Route Tables** section.
   - Select the route table for Aja private subnet (e.g., `Aja-Pvt-Rt`).
   - Click **Edit Routes** and add:
     - **Destination**: Dell VPC CIDR block (e.g., `192.168.0.0/16`).
     - **Target**: The VPC peering connection (e.g., `Aja-Dell-Peering`).
   - Save the route.

2. **Modify Dell VPC's Route Table**:
   - Navigate to the **Route Tables** section.
   - Select the route table for Dell private subnet (e.g., `Dell-Pvt-Rt`).
   - Click **Edit Routes** and add:
     - **Destination**: Aja VPC CIDR block.
     - **Target**: The VPC peering connection (e.g., `Aja-Dell-Peering`).
   - Save the route.

### **Verification**
- Launch EC2 instances in the private subnets of both VPCs.
- Test connectivity using `ping` or application traffic.
- Ensure that **security groups** in both VPCs allow the required inbound and outbound traffic.

With VPC Peering and updated routes, the private networks of Aja and Dell VPCs can now communicate seamlessly!
