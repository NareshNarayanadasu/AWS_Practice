### **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

Amazon EBS is a scalable, high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances. It provides persistent, reliable storage for applications requiring high availability and fast I/O.

---

### **Key Features**

1. **Durability and Persistence**  
   Data remains intact even if the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.

2. **Scalability**  
   Volumes can be resized or upgraded using snapshots or directly through the console.

3. **Availability Zone (AZ) Specific**  
   EBS volumes are tied to a specific availability zone and can only be attached to instances within that AZ.

4. **Data Backup (Snapshots)**  
   Snapshots allow you to create point-in-time backups that are incremental and stored in Amazon S3. These can also be copied to other regions.

5. **Encryption**  
   - Encrypted volumes use the **AES-256 algorithm** and are managed through AWS Key Management Service (KMS).  
   - Encryption applies to volumes, data in transit, and snapshots.  

6. **High Availability**  
   EBS automatically replicates within the AZ for durability and reliability.

7. **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing**  
   Users are charged for the provisioned size, not for consumed space.

### **Types of EBS Volumes**

#### **1. SSD (Solid State Drives)**
   - Ideal for fast, small I/O operations.

   **General Purpose SSD (GP2/GP3)**  
   - Balanced performance for most workloads.  
   - GP3 is the successor to GP2, offering higher baseline IOPS and throughput at a lower cost.

   **Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1/IO2)**  
   - High-performance for IO-intensive workloads.  
   - Supports multiple EBS volumes attached to a single EC2 instance.

#### **2. HDD (Hard Disk Drives)**
   - Suitable for large, sequential data access.

   **Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)**  
   - Designed for frequently accessed, large data sets.

   **Cold HDD (SC1)**  
   - Lowest-cost storage for infrequently accessed data.

### **Snapshots**

EBS Snapshots are point-in-time backups stored in Amazon S3.  
- Snapshots are **region-specific** but can be copied across regions.  
- Incremental snapshots only back up changes from the last snapshot, saving storage costs.

### **LAB Walkthrough**

#### **Step 1: Create and Attach EBS to EC2**

1. **Launch EC2 Instance**:
   - OS: Linux  
   - Add a 5 GB EBS volume during instance creation.

2. **Connect to EC2 Instance**:  
   ```bash
   ssh -i <key.pem> ec2-user@<public-ip>
   ```

3. **List and Format Attached Volume**:
   ```bash
   lsblk                      # List block devices  
   sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb  # Format the new volume
   ```

4. **Mount the Volume**:  
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /app-data  
   sudo mount /dev/xvdb /app-data  
   sudo chown ec2-user:ec2-user /app-data  
   ```

#### **Step 2: Detach and Attach to Another EC2**

1. **Unmount and Detach Volume**:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /dev/xvdb
   ```
   - Go to **EBS > Volumes**, select the volume, and click **Detach Volume**.

2. **Launch a New EC2 in Same AZ**:
   - Ensure the new instance is in the same AZ as the volume.

3. **Attach Volume to New EC2**:
   - Select the volume, choose **Actions > Attach Volume**, and select the new EC2.

4. **Mount the Volume on the New Instance**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /app-vol  
   sudo mount /dev/xvdb /app-vol  
   ```

#### **Step 3: Transfer Volume Across AZs**

1. **Create a Snapshot**:
   - Go to **EBS > Volumes**, select the volume, and click **Actions > Create Snapshot**.

2. **Create New Volume from Snapshot in Desired AZ**:
   - Go to **Snapshots**, select the snapshot, and choose **Actions > Create Volume**.

3. **Attach the New Volume to an Instance in the New AZ**:
   - Repeat the steps for attaching and mounting the volume.

### **EBS Use Cases**

1. **Database Storage**:  
   For relational and NoSQL databases requiring high-performance and durability.

2. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**:  
   Use snapshots for incremental backups and region-to-region disaster recovery.

3. **Big Data and Analytics**:  
   Utilize throughput-optimized volumes for large-scale data processing.

4. **Application Hosting**:  
   Host critical applications requiring persistent storage.
